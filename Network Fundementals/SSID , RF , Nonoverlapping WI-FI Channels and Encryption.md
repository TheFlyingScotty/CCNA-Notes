**Wireless Principles**:

1. **Nonoverlapping Wi-Fi Channels**:  
   - Wi-Fi operates on frequency bands (e.g., 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz).  
   - In the 2.4 GHz band, only 3 channels (1, 6, and 11) are nonoverlapping, minimizing interference.  
   - In the 5 GHz band, there are more nonoverlapping channels, providing better performance and reduced interference.  

2. **SSID (Service Set Identifier)**:  
   - The SSID is the name of a wireless network, allowing devices to identify and connect to it.  
   - It is broadcast by access points and can be hidden for additional security.  

3. **RF (Radio Frequency)**:  
   - Wireless communication uses RF signals to transmit data over the air.  
   - RF characteristics, such as frequency, signal strength, and interference, affect wireless performance and coverage.  

4. **Encryption**:  
   - Encryption secures wireless communication by encoding data to prevent unauthorized access.  
   - Common encryption protocols include [[WPA2]] and [[WPA3]], which protect data and ensure secure authentication.
