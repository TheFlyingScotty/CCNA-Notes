Endpoints are devices that connect to a network and serve as the source or destination of data. Examples include computers, smartphones, tablets, printers, and IoT devices.

**Role**:  
Endpoints enable users to interact with the network, access resources, and perform tasks. They act as the interface between the user and the network infrastructure.

**Functions**:

1. **Data Generation and Consumption**:
    
    - Endpoints generate data (e.g., sending emails, uploading files) and consume data (e.g., downloading files, streaming media).
2. **Network Communication**:
    
    - Facilitate communication with other devices and services over the network using protocols like [[HTTP]], [[FTP]], or [[SSH]].
3. **Authentication and Access**:
    
    - Authenticate with network resources (e.g., servers, applications) to gain access to services and data.
4. **Security Enforcement**:
    
    - Implement security measures such as antivirus software, encryption, and firewalls to protect against threats.
5. **Device Management**:
    
    - Can be monitored and managed by centralized tools for updates, compliance, and security policies.

In summary, endpoints are critical components of a network, enabling users to interact with and utilize network resources while also serving as a focus for security and management efforts.
