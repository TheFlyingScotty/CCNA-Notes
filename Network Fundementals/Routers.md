  Routers are network devices that operate at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model. Their primary role is to connect multiple networks and forward data packets between them. Routers use IP addresses to determine the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination.

Functions of Routers:

1. **Packet Forwarding**: Routers examine the destination IP address in a packet and forward it to the appropriate next-hop device or network.
2. **Path Selection**: Routers use routing tables and protocols (e.g., [[OSPF]], [[EIGRP]], [[BGP]]) to determine the most efficient path for data.
3. **Network Segmentation**: Routers separate broadcast domains, reducing unnecessary traffic and improving network performance.
4. **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Routers enable communication between different VLANs in a network.
5. **Security**: Routers can implement [[access control lists (ACL)]] to filter traffic and enforce security policies.
6. **[[NAT]] (Network Address Translation)**: Routers can translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses, allowing devices in a private network to access the internet.

In summary, routers are essential for enabling communication between different networks, optimizing data flow, and maintaining network segmentation and security.
