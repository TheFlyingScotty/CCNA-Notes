Cisco DNA Center and Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) are network management tools that provide centralized control and automation for network devices and wireless infrastructure.

**Cisco DNA Center**:

- **Role**: Acts as a centralized network management and automation platform for enterprise networks.
- **Functions**:
    1. **Network Automation**: Simplifies configuration and deployment of devices using templates and policies.
    2. **Assurance and Analytics**: Provides real-time insights into network performance and user experience.
    3. **Policy Management**: Enables intent-based networking by defining and enforcing policies across the network.
    4. **Security Integration**: Works with Cisco security tools to detect and mitigate threats.
    5. **Software-Defined Access (SD-Access)**: Automates segmentation and access control for users and devices.

**Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**:

- **Role**: Manages and controls multiple wireless access points in a centralized manner.
- **Functions**:
    1. **Access Point Management**: Configures and monitors access points, including firmware updates and settings.
    2. **SSID and VLAN Management**: Manages wireless SSIDs and maps them to VLANs for traffic segmentation.
    3. **Roaming Support**: Ensures seamless handoff for clients moving between access points.
    4. **Security Enforcement**: Implements wireless security policies, including authentication and encryption.
    5. **Traffic Optimization**: Balances wireless traffic and reduces interference for better performance.

In summary, Cisco DNA Center provides centralized automation and analytics for wired and wireless networks, while WLCs focus specifically on managing and optimizing wireless infrastructure. Both tools enhance network efficiency, security, and scalability.
