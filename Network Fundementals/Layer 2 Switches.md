**Layer 2 Switches**:

- **Role**: Operate at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
- **Function**:
    1. Forward traffic based on MAC addresses.
    2. Build and maintain a MAC address table to map devices to specific switch ports.
    3. Create separate collision domains for each port, reducing network collisions.
    4. Support VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to segment traffic within a network.
    5. Do not perform routing; they only handle traffic within the same VLAN or subnet.


Layer 2 Switches vs Layer 3 : Â Layer 2 switches handle traffic within the same VLAN or subnet, while Layer 3 switches add routing capabilities to enable communication between VLANs or subnets, making them more versatile in modern networks.
