Servers are powerful computers or devices that provide resources, services, or applications to other devices (clients) on a network.

**Role**:  
Servers act as centralized resources in a network, enabling multiple clients to access shared data, applications, and services efficiently.

**Functions**:

1. **Resource Sharing**:
    
    - Provide shared access to files, printers, databases, and other resources.
2. **Application Hosting**:
    
    - Host applications such as web servers, email servers, and database servers for client use.
3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    
    - Manage user authentication and enforce access control policies (e.g., Active Directory).
4. **Data Storage and Backup**:
    
    - Store and manage large volumes of data and ensure data redundancy through backups.
5. **Centralized Management**:
    
    - Simplify network management by centralizing updates, configurations, and monitoring.
6. **High Availability**:
    
    - Provide redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure continuous service availability.

Servers are essential for delivering centralized services, managing resources, and supporting the functionality of networks and applications.
