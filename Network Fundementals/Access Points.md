Access Points (APs) are network devices that provide wireless connectivity to a wired network, enabling wireless devices such as laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices to connect to the network.

**Role**:  
The primary role of an access point is to act as a bridge between wireless clients and the wired network, extending network coverage and enabling mobility for users.

**Functions**:

1. **Wireless Connectivity**:
    
    - Provides Wi-Fi access to devices, allowing them to connect to the network without physical cables.
2. **Network Bridging**:
    
    - Bridges wireless traffic to the wired network, enabling communication between wireless and wired devices.
3. **SSID Broadcasting**:
    
    - Advertises the network's Service Set Identifier (SSID) so wireless clients can discover and connect to the network.
4. **Authentication and Encryption**:
    
    - Supports security protocols like WPA2/WPA3 to authenticate users and encrypt wireless traffic.
5. **Traffic Management**:
    
    - Manages wireless traffic to ensure efficient communication and prevent interference.
6. **Roaming Support**:
    
    - Allows seamless handoff of wireless clients between access points in the same network, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity.

In summary, access points enable wireless devices to connect to a wired network, providing mobility, flexibility, and secure communication in homes, offices, and public spaces.
