- **Role**: Operate at both the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
- **Function**:
    1. Perform all Layer 2 switching functions, such as forwarding traffic based on MAC addresses.
    2. Route traffic between different VLANs or subnets using IP addresses.
    3. Use routing tables and protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP) to make routing decisions.
    4. Provide high-speed inter-VLAN routing, often replacing traditional routers in enterprise networks.
    5. Support advanced features like Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Quality of Service (QoS).


Layer 2 Switches vs Layer 3 : Â Layer 2 switches handle traffic within the same VLAN or subnet, while Layer 3 switches add routing capabilities to enable communication between VLANs or subnets, making them more versatile in modern networks.
