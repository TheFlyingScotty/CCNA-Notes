# What Metrics are used to calculate EIGRP composite metric
- EIGRP used Bandwidth and delay to calculate the composite metric which is used to determine the best path to a destination network. Bandwidth refers to the dada throughput of a link Delay refers to the time required to send a packet to its destination.

# EIGRP terms and their definitions

 Feasible Distance : The best metric along a path
 Successor: The best path to a destination network
 Feasible Successor:  A backup path that is guaranteed to be loop-free
 Advertised Distance: The metric that the next-hop router has calculated
